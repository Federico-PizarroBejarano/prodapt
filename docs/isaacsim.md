## Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is an Nvidia robotics simulator with very powerful GPU-acceleration, parallelization, and photo-realism. It can be used to not only simulate the the UR10e robot but also simulate object collisions and interactions, allowing for simulating complex tasks with the UR10e. Follow these steps to set up the UR10e simulation:

### Steps:
1. Open the Omniverse Launcher and click the "Launch" button for Isaac Sim.
2. Select Isaac Sim, and ensure that "Show startup console" is checked. Then click "Start".
3. Once Isaac Sim has loaded, ensure the ROS2 Bridge extension is active by going to "Window/Extensions" and searching for "ROS2". Enable it if it is not active (and set Autoload if desired).
4. Open `~/prodapt/resources/ur10_prodapt.usd`. This should load the UR10 with everything properly configured.
5. When ready to run, click the Play button on the left.
